## üß† Integrated APIs

### 1. ü§ñ Hugging Face Inference API (AI Chatbot)

We‚Äôve integrated a Hugging Face model via their Inference API to serve as a smart **AI chatbot** for customer support. Users can ask food-related questions or get recommendations in real-time.

- **Use case:** Responds to user queries (e.g., food suggestions, ingredients, delivery time).
- **Tech:** Hugging Face Inference API with a conversational NLP model.
- **Integration:** Django views handle API calls and display responses via the chatbot UI.

### 2. üõ†Ô∏è Flask RESTful API (Custom Microservice)

We‚Äôve built a custom **Flask RESTful API** to handle features that are decoupled from the main Django app. This includes:

- **Recommendation Engine:** Suggest dishes based on past user orders.
- **Order Analytics:** Tracks and analyzes user order history.
- **Microservice Architecture:** Designed for scalability and modularity.

> Hosted independently and consumed by Django via HTTP requests (using `requests` library or AJAX).
